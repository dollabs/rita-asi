# Welcome to the Minecraft UROP team

This documentation is written to help you set up and navigate our project repository. You are recommended to follow the documentation pages in sequence to learn the background, the human behaviors, the codes and the tools.

This documentation is being developed as your UROP progresses, so don't hesitate to ask Yang via [email](ztyang@mit.edu) or Slack if you have any questions.

## Upcoming Zoom talks

During each week's Mon 2-3 pm meetings, everyone will share their progress, blocks, and ideas in the first half an hour.
