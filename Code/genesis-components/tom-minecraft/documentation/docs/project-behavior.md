# Human behavior in Minecraft SAR missions

In week 2 and 3, we will focus on understanding human behavior. Note that we have a different plan for Anna/Isabelle and for Christian/Darren in Week 2.

For Anna and Isabelle, you will focus on watching videos from both Pilot test 1 and Pilot test 2.

For Christian and Darren, you will focus on watching videos from ONLY Pilot test 1, until you have finished participating in ASU Pilot test. That's because the experiment design of our Pilot test 2 may spoil your ASU Pilot experience.

In week 3, we will move onto Pilot test 2 and 3.

## Pilot test 1: Maze of size 45 by 46, player

In Pilot test 1, we want to see how human players behave in a SAR mission given two different goals: (1) triage all victims in the maze, (2) maximize the number of victims triaged within 10 minutes. Victims with different colors take different amount of time. From blue, green, yellow, orange, to red, they take 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 seconds. Players are allowed to turn on lights, clear blockage, and put out fire.

### Pilot test 2: Maze of size 24 by 24, player

For Christian and Darren, please stop reading further until have finished participating in ASU Pilot test. The experiment design of our Pilot test 2 may spoil your ASU Pilot experience.

In Pilot test 2, we want to see how human players behave in SAR missions that have tight time constraints and different initial training conditions. The time limit of each player depends on his game expertise and ranges from 2-3 min. Each player will go through all three training conditions as described below:

### Pilot test 3: Maze of size 24 by 24, observer

In Pilot test 3, we want to see how good are humans in predicting actions?
