# How to review the literature

Here is Dylan's notes from the discussions in the Genesis story understanding group.

1. Triage with abstracts: If the paper seems like a merely incremental
change on a topic you already know, you can skip it.  You can practice
making these snap assessments.

2. Read authors, not papers:  Focus on understanding the work of
particular researchers in general so you can contextualize all of
their papers without reading all of their papers.

3. Breadth-first citation:  Starting with a few stand-out papers,
recursively follow the interesting references in breadth-first order.

4. Ask an expert: Don't try to read everything. Ask someone who's read
everything what you should read.  Rely on networks of trusted people
to highlight good papers.

5. Read using effective-writing rules: For example, you can use VSNC
to parse an abstract or paper.

6. Alternate absorbing and synthesizing:  Take time in between bouts
of reading to restate what you've read, draw connections, imagine
applications, and dream up new possibilities.  Reading for
understanding is a constructive process.

7a. Note what others think is relevant:  When others suggest related
work, they're partly telling you what they think your work is.  If
they're off-base, it's an opportunity to clarify your own area. (Pay
attention to misunderstandings).

7b.  Get past "Isn't this just X?": One particularly reductive form of
misunderstanding is "Isn't your work just [topic]?".  It isn't really
actionable, as it's the consequence of a listener who has simply
stopped too early. Tells you more about the listener than about how to
present your work.
