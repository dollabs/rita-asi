Without the device, these missions would be a lot harder and would take more time to prioritise yellow victims. It saves time because you can quickly walk into a room to gauge whether there was a yellow victim in the room or not. You do not need to waste your time searching the entire room for a yellow victim that may or may not be there. With that time saved you can investigate other rooms for prioritised victims.",My strategy was to walk along the main corridor of the building from north to south and check every room along the way with the device for the yellow victims.,"After learning that there would be blockages and rubble in mission 1, I split up my plan into parts and labelled each room with their respective plan. This would help me organise my attempt so that I may think clearer. This path followed the same coverage as the first, where I would walk the main halls from north to south checking all rooms.",In the last two missions I was unable to rescue all yellow victims. In mission 3 I changed my path planning so that I would check all rooms but walk from west to east vertically. I feel like this was my best plan and I condensed the plan into 3 parts instead of 4 so that it would be more streamlined.,"Yes. At first I thought I would be able to freely walk along the corridors and check every room individually. However after learning that there were obstacles in the way that would block some doorways and corridors, I changed my plan to accommodate that. Instead of a plan to walk through all the corridors, I labelled each room so that I would know which room to go to instead of sticking to the path drawn. This was because there could be obstacles in the way of my path drawn and I would be unable to get through it. Some walls between rooms collapse allowing me easy access from one room to another, and my labelling what room I need to go to next, I can utilise these wall collapses to quickly gain access to the next room I need to go to.
