MAIN GOALS:
1. retell story from a character's POV
2. answer WHY questions from mental models
3. reconciliation / conflict resolution
4. infer entrances/exits

NEXT STEPS:
- finish July2016 refactor:
    - restore TELL functionality
    - infer Enter/Exit in EnterExit3a instead of "Bobby enters the kitchen."
    - restore DID OBSERVE question-answering functionality
    - should characters in a container be able to observe others entering/exiting?

- Fix False Belief story as demo

- from 4/26 discussion: look into:
	 method of representing 1-way observations: is within earshot of (Dylan)
	 maybe a lot of the processing is on demand, e.g. only do it if asked "Does Emily know that Bobby is in the kitchen?"

- fix TODOs in Les Mis 2
- enable questions in Les Mis 2 (esp. "Why do Javert and JV disagree?" (reconciliation))
- Instantiate different mental models with different rules (see Mental model sample)
	- Javert's rule: "If xx is a criminal, then xx cannot stop being a criminal."
- refactor Observations to answer DID questions from Actor.mentalModel
- see entity properties <- to see if I should use Entity instead of Actor
- fix TODOs (in ObservationsFactory, JessicasExpert, ...)

- answer "What does Javert think/believe?"
- answer "Who observed that [event]?"

MISC
- test "Did Macbeth murder Duncan because Duncan is a king"
- read Winograd's thesis scenario
- read Dyer paper
- think about this from 8/10/2015: "Problem w genesis: it can't read stories told in show-dont-tell style"

- Make this work:
If xx is happy and yy is happy, then xx and yy clap.
//
A becomes happy
B becomes happy
//A,B clap
A stops being happy
C becomes happy
//B,C clap (not A,C)
C stops being happy
B stops being happy
A becomes happy
D becomes happy
//A,D clap
/*
Q: When B was happy, was D happy? -> NO
//
How to achieve this? Ideas:
hack: Genesis rereads with if-then rule
temporal mental model
assume elaboration graph is correct timeline
assume story is correct timeline
*/

ADMISSIBLE -> CONSISTENT:
- tell story with less explanation (eg see "Tell story as Jean Valjean" for over-explaining)
- fix JessicasDisplay to display text output (ie DidQuestion answers & story retelling)
- improve DID questions to answer yellow-box questions with "Yes, inferred from [event]"
- write first-to-third-person tense-changer (start with simple name/pronouncs replace). See: 
	- Sila's filtering
	- Sila's educational storytelling (what level of spoonfeeding)
	- Mpfay's thing where the story tells itself given good character sketches)
- removed unused files (and references to them): Actor, Observations, ObservationsFactory, JessicasDisplay

STORIES TO WRITE/TEST:
- a story from a play, s.t. enter/exit are valid
- "anyone lived..." with "Anyone is a person"
- false-belief test
	- child's mental model is objective model of world; child is same as reader/Genesis/objective observer
*- Les Mis, following scenario in my slides
- gift of the Magi

DISPLAY:
*- fix JessicasDisplay
- display both label and table in GUI
- table formatting
	- resizing (see GridLayout?)
	- colored cells
	- pin left column (or create row labels)

WIKI:
- FAQ
- make TableView template classes
