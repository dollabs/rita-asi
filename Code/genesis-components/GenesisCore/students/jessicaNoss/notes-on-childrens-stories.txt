The gingerbread men lay quietly, their frosted eyes gazing at the sky with its puffy clouds.

Everyone looked to see who was speaking.
It was a butterfly flying just outside the window.

Ex. 2:
Pleased to hear that he had a friend, the little gingerbread man was about to reply when again they [the gingerbread man and the butterfly] were interrupted. A farmer's dog with a keen nose had come to investigate.

And before the butterfly had finished speaking, children appeared in the yard.

At last the little gingerbread man and the butterfly reached a stream. ... From out behind a bush sauntered a red fox...

Then one day, shortly before Easter, three bunny rabbits were placed on the shelf beside him [Wolstencroft the bear].  They all had very big ears and feet and long legs. All three were wearing woolen sweaters.  Rita Rabbit wore a pink sweater. Roger Rabbit a green one. And Ronnie wore blue.

Ex. 2:
... he looked up into the night and to four strange lights among the stars. They came and spoke one by one ... Venus said: "..." ... Mars said: "..." ...

In the fruitbowl ... was the fruit.  Banana said "When I get out of here I'm going to be a banana split!"
"Ooh," said the others "that's nice."
Orange said "When I get out of here I'm going to be orange juice!" ...
[note: from this we can infer that Orange was listening from the beginning.]

Ex. 4:

... when he was placed on the table, there were all of his friends.  "What are you doing here?"  
Banana said "..."
 

== implicit presence via dialogue ==
