- Eliminated edit distance for disambiguation
- Wrote ThreadTree and WeightedNode; started to implement visual disambiguation

Problems: Memory already consolidates memories. Is there any way to get around this?

- Implemented propagation

Problems: Still, dealing with memory. It consolidates the memories. We need to get exactly what went in. This might
involve grabbing the SOMs. 

Solution: Keep my own memory structure.

Ideas: Find impact per type. As it is now, the impacts of types are summed. This favors longer threads. 
Progress: Disambiguates well
Problems: Got hawk wrong once. Can't figure out why. Have to sleep now. 

Still to do: Visualization. At least text, to show the reasoning process.
