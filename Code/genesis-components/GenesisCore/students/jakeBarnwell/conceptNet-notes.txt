Should have an API method to find relationship between two 
non-directly-connected nodes. e.g. for A-B-C, what if we 
want the relationship between A and C? Then return that 
there is a path from A to B to C. This is useful for e.g.
rel(harm, slap) which is the empty set, though there is
surely a path from one to the other.

is there a way to visualize this stuff? that would be cool!

Do a bfs on network to find relatedness between 2 words

Genesis goal:
+ "x harms y, y hits x"
+ "x slaps y, y embarasses x"
- "x hugs y, y hurts x"
Is the following an example of revenge?
? "x kills y, y hugs x"
[Genesis should say yes/no]

A way to gather related concepts by an edge (over/under) threshold
