<h2>Using GenAssist</h2>

<p>Type a story or any number of sentences into the main text area, or use the File menu to open a story file. Use the Story menu (or press Ctrl-R (Cmd-R on Mac)) to "analyze" the story. This will produce a pop-up window that will update with results for each sentence as it is analyzed. Problematic sentences are colored red, and parsable sentences are colored green. Click on a sentence to get detailed information on which tests succeeded and failed, as well as useful information like what triples were generated out of that sentence from Start or what the Innerese for that sentence looks like.</p>

<p>GenAssist analyzes sentences individually rather than as contextually whole story. The aim is to provide a quick way to determine whether Genesis will understand a given batch of sentences and correct potential problems. If all of your sentences are green, you're ready to move to Genesis. Currently, the best way to do this is to use File -> Save to write your text file to the file system and then open it up as you normally would in Genesis. (Yeah, that could use some work.) </p>


<h2>About GenAssist</h2>

<p>GenAssist is still fairly rudimentary, but it can be used to process many sentences at once to determine whether or not Start can parse them into triples, which triples they are parsed into, what Innerese is generated from them, and what Genesese is produced back out from that Innerese.
