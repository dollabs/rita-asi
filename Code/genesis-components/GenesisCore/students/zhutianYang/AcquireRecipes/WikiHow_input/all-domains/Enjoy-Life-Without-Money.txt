Enjoy Life Without Money

Steps
Method 1
Finding Free, Fun Activities
1
Go for hikes on free trails in your area. Many cities have walking trails that people can enjoy safely and free of charge. Look online or contact your local municipal government to see what scenic nature trails are accessible in your area. Be sure to wear athletic shoes, comfortable clothing, and sunscreen for your hikes, and bring water to stay hydrated.[1]
Avoid hiking on unmarked trails, where you may get lost or injured.
2
Play outdoor sports with friends. Sports like soccer, football, frisbee, and rugby can easily be played for free. Bring together a group of friends to play occasional or regular games in a nearby park or field. If you want more players, post game times and locations on your social media accounts to look for additional players.[2]
3
Visit free, public-access beaches. Relaxing on a beach is the ultimate fun, leisure activity outdoors, and it can also be budget-friendly. Look online for free access beaches in your area that you can visit with friends or family. Pack towels, food, drinks, sunscreen, and flip flops and you're good to go!
4
Spend time at your local library. A membership at your local library is a great way to keep yourself entertained and stimulate your intellect. Visit the librarian's desk to sign up for a free library card, which will allow you to borrow books, as well as magazines and DVDs in some locations. Some libraries also feature free activities like book clubs or poetry readings to keep things interesting.[3]
Bring a proof of your current address with you when you sign up for your library card, like a utilities bill.
5
Visit museums, aquariums, or zoos on free admission days. Taking advantage of free days is a great way to experience your city's culture without spending money. Check the websites for your local museums, aquariums, or zoos to see if they have any special free admission days coming up. These days will be especially busy so be sure to arrive early to ensure that you beat the crowds to access the exhibits.[4]
6
Play board games with family and friends. Game nights are a great way to spend quality time with loved ones without spending money. Invite people over to play a group game that is fun, interactive, and lively. For extra fun, make it a BYOB night and provide some inexpensive snacks to enhance the evening.[5]
Method 2
Eating Well
1
Visit farmer's markets before closing time to negotiate prices. Fresh produce can be expensive, but it is an important part of a healthy and satisfying diet. Shop for deals at you local farmer's market, buying only what is in season and inexpensive. For greater savings, visit the market near closing time and ask vendors if they'd be willing to sell some of their remaining stock at a discounted price.[6]
2
Dress up affordable meals to make them seem fancier. Having a limited food budget does not mean that you can't enjoy your dining experiences. Dress up basic foods with extra spices and garnishes to make them more interesting and appetizing. Set the mood for a more luxurious dining experience by plating your food in interesting ways or lighting candles.
For instance, dress up boxed macaroni and cheese with garlic flakes and oregano and serve it with a fresh parsley garnish.
3
Host potluck gatherings. Potlucks are parties where each guest brings a favorite dish to create a large, eclectic feast. Host potluck gatherings at your home for friends, family, neighbors, and colleagues to benefit from their culinary offerings in exchange for your hospitality. Ask guests to share what they will be bringing ahead of time so you can keep track of what foods will be served.[7]
4
Visit a local food bank if you can't make ends meet. Food banks offer groceries to economically disadvantaged people living in the area at no cost. If you are having difficulty affording food, visit a food bank in your area to seek assistance. Food banks are often hosted by churches or other non-profit organizations.
Method 3
Getting New Things
1
Update your wardrobe at clothing swaps. Clothes swaps are meetups where you can bring clothing you no longer want and trade it for garments brought by other people. They are a great way to freshen your look and meet friends without spending any money. Look online for clothing swaps in your area, or organize one with friends or social media contacts.[8]
Organize larger clothing swaps by handing out tickets or vouchers for each item a person brings, which can then be used to procure another item.
2
Visit garage sales and flea markets for inexpensive new decor. Garage sales and flea markets are a great way to find unique, interesting items to add to your home for next to no money. Keep an eye on local newspaper listings and social media for events like this happening in your community. Be sure to arrive early to ensure that you get the best selection of the day's deals and offerings.[9]
3
Trade books online or at a book swap. If you have read books that you are ready to get rid of, look for book swapping events in your area. If no live events are happening, visit an book trading website to barter books. Certain sites will find people interested in your books, then send you credits for what you've traded to obtain other books listed on the site.[10]
4
Practice extreme couponing. Extreme couponing involves combining coupons and promotions to get hefty savings on in-store items at grocery stores, department stores, and pharmacies. Look online for coupons for your favorite products to print out and use. Compare prices and weekly sales at different stores to make sure that your coupon savings will go as far as possible.[11]
Method 4
Travelling Frugally
1
Get a ride to travel destinations with family, friends, or acquaintances. If people you know are driving to a location you would like to visit, take advantage of the opportunity to ask them for a lift. Offer to help with gas money or, if you don't have any cash, offer a trade or service instead. Be a polite and respectful co-traveller to show your appreciation for their generosity.
For instance, offer free babysitting or guitar lessons to a friend in exchange for a ride to a city they are visiting.
2
Get to new destinations with ridesharing services. There a many ridesharing websites and apps that allow budget travellers to find a shared lift to their destination. These sites will also screen and identify the drivers, making the ridesharing experience safe and simple. Search for available rideshares in your area, which may vary in cost but will cost significantly less than traveling alone.[12]
3
Practice safe hitchhiking to get around. Hitchhiking is a free way to travel, but you need to take precautions to make it safe. Ask each driver several questions before getting in the vehicle, including what their name is, where they are heading and why they are going there. Follow your gut instinct and avoid getting into a car with anyone who gives you a bad feeling.[13]
Wait near a stop sign or stop light to give drivers a chance to pull over.
Stick out your thumb, which is a universal signal for hitchhiking, to attract attention.
4
Join a free hospitality-sharing community. Find free accommodations in other cities and meet new friends by joining a couchsurfing community online. You will be able to chat with participating members living in the area you are travelling to and arrange accommodations before travelling. In addition to being able to sleep on someone's couch or in their spare room, you may find someone to show you around the city.[14]
