Make Mashed Potato Gravy Bombs

Steps
Part 1
Preparing the Ingredients
1
Pour the gravy into an ice cube tray. Pour enough gravy into each mold, making sure it reaches the top, but doesn't spill over.
2
Freeze the gravy for about 4 hours, or overnight, until solid.
3
Remove and slice the gravy cubes. Use a knife to cut each cube into four small pieces.
To make the cubes easier to cut, allow them to soften for a few minutes after removing them from the freezer. A knife that's been dipped in hot water can also make slicing easier.
4
Combine the mashed potatoes with the cheese and spices in a large bowl. Mix the Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, salt, and black pepper very well with the mashed potatoes until the result is creamy.
5
Place the beaten eggs, flour, and breadcrumbs in three separate bowls. Use bowls that are deep, so it's easier to roll the mashed potato balls in the coating.
Part 2
Frying the Potato Bombs
1
Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 375° Fahrenheit (190° Celsius).
2
Cover each gravy cube with two tablespoons of mashed potatoes. Gently roll the mixture around to form the a ball that covers the gravy cube. Repeat until there are no more gravy cubes and mashed potatoes.
3
Roll the balls in the flour. If necessary, gently tap or shake them to remove any excess flour.
4
Dip the balls into the beaten eggs until they're completely covered.
5
Cover the balls with the breadcrumbs until they're fully covered.
6
Fry the mashed potato gravy bombs until golden brown. Allow them to cook for about 3-4 minutes. Only fry a few at a time to prevent them from sticking together while they're cooking.
7
Place the cooked balls on a paper towel on a plate. Continue frying the remaining balls until all of them are cooked.
8
Serve. The mashed potato gravy bombs are best warm, after a few minutes of cooling. Eat them plain or dunk them in more gravy, a cheese sauce, or ketchup. Enjoy!
