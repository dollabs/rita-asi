Make Your Own Sitar Pick (Mezrab)

Steps
1
Get a bobby pin or hair pin and a pair of pliers (the smaller the pliers the better).
2
Bend the pin to fit your finger in. The pin should make a V or curved shape, around the point of your finger, with each end pointing back towards your wrist.
3
Find the point of your last finger joint. At that point, bend each pin end outwards so it's perpendicular to your finger and pointing to each side of your finger (the ends should point opposite directions).
4
Bend each long bit of the pin in half so it points to the other side of the main triangle section.
5
Hook the tips around the base of the triangle its closest to.
6
Bend the sides backwards slightly to make it have a 'Y' shape to aid the grip of your finger.
