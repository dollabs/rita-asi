Start story titled "News1".

//It was July 29.
There were about 35 people at an annual summer party in Tiverton.
Ten people were in the pool at the time.
Anselmo walked from a swing set to the fence.
His attention was drawn to James.
At first, the boy looked as if he was swimming in circles.
But he then went under the water and he didnâ€™t come up.
Anselmo yelled to Correia, who jumped into the pool.
He jumped over the fence and into the water.
Together they pulled up the boy, handing him to an uncle.
Jayme DeMello gave him chest compressions.
The gunk and water poured out of his mouth and nose.
Sarah was doing rescue-breathing to him.
Tiverton rescue personnel arrived as the boy was coming back to life.
They transported him to Hospital in Providence.
He stayed overnight for observation.
The end.
