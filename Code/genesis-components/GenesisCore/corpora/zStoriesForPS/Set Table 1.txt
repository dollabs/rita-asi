Start story titled "Set Table 1".

The forks are positioned to the left of the plate - first the Table Fork and then the Fish Fork.
To the right of the plate are the knives - first the Table Knife then the Fish Knife, each with its sharp edge facing towards the plate.
The Table Spoon for soup goes next to the knives.
The Fruit Fork and Fruit Spoon are positioned horizontally above the plate, with the handle of the fork towards the left and of the spoon towards the right.
A Fruit Knife may be inserted between these two, facing in the same direction as the spoon.
The fruit cutlery may be joined by a Dessert Fork to complement the desserts.
The glasses are positioned slightly to the right of the plate, at about the same height as the knife.
There should be at least two glasses - a larger one for water and, to its right, a smaller one for wine.
If more than one wine is to be served during the meal, the number of glasses increases, always being positioned to the right of the water glass.
To complement the arrangement, place markers may be added in front of each setting.

The end.
