Start story titled "Set Table 1".

begin by setting a charger in the center of the place.

the charger is a large dish that serves as the under plate for courses there precede the main entree.

place a dinner fork on the left and a dinner knife on the right.

notice that the knife blade is turned toward the center.

this is a formal tradition dating back to when dinner guests had very sharp knives it was polite to keep the knife blade turned away from the guests to your side.

add the salad fork outside of the dinner fork because you'll have salad before the main course.

then if you have a salad knife add that outside of the dinner knife.

if you are serving soup it comes first so the soup spoon goes outside of the knives and on the right side.

you always eat with the outer more silverware first working your way in toward the center but only sent out the silverware you need.

so if you're not serving soup don't put out a soup spoon.

now if you're having ice cream for dessert you'll need a spoon for that.

the dessert spoon goes at the top with the handle to the right.

that way you can easily move it to the appropriate spot when it's dessert time like this.

if you are having cake then a fork goes up at the top.

turned like this so you can slide it down later.

now we add a dinner plate in the center.

the bread plate goes up in the left corner.

the Butter knife goes at an angle.

any glasses will be placed in the upper right corner.

finally the napkin traditionally goes to the left of the forks but it can also be placed under the forks.

or for a unique touch you can fold it up like this and place the napkin in the center this.

looks super fancy and can clear up some table space.

finally set out any flowers candlesticks or centerpiece decorations you like.

and there you have it.

now all you need is a meal with that certain genetic Wow.

The end.
