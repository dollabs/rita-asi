The bird flew to the tree.
Patrick loves spam.
The car crashed into the pole.
A bird flew through the window.
A man, a plan, a canal, panama.
The bird flew to the ball.
The man died.
The car slammed! 
into a tree.
The speed of the car increased.


The bird flew to a street.
The birdman flew to a pond.
The bird flew to a tree.
