Estonia and Russia are countries.

Estonia built many computer networks to help manage its government, telecommunications and economy.  

Estonia relocated a war memorial to Russian soldiers because Estonia did not respect Russia.  
Russia felt the relocation of the war memorial insulted Russia. 
Russia also believed that Estonia was mistreating Russians living in Estonia.

Someone attacked Estonia's computer networks after Estonia insulted Russia.  
The attacks caused some of Estonia's computer networks to stop working 
and the stoppage harmed Estonia's economy, government and telecommunications. 

After the attacks, Estonia created a center to study computer security. Other states in NATO began to support the center. 

The end.
