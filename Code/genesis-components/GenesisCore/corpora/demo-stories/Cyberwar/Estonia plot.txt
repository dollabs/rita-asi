Computer networks are a kind of artifact.

Estonia built Estonia's computer networks.

Estonia insulted Russia because Estonia relocated a war memorial.  

// Russia wanted to harm Estonia.

Russia is bigger than Estonia.

Estonia relocated the war memorial because Estonia did not respect Russia.

Someone attacked Estonia's computer networks after Estonia harmed Russia.

// Russia attacked Estonia's computer networks.

The attack on Estonia's computer networks included the jamming of the web sites.  

The jamming of the sites showed that someone did not respect Estonia.

Estonia created a center to study computer security.  

Estonia believed other states would support the center.

The end.
