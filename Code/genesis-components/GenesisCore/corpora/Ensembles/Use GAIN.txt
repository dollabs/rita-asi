I am a person.
catchup is an entity.
glass is an entity.
liquid is an entity.
engine oil is an entity.
T-shirt is an entity.

zz is a person.
xx, yy and kk are entities.

If xx spills over zz's yy, then xx is on yy.
If xx pours from yy to zz's kk, then xx is on kk.
If xx spatters on zz's yy, then xx is on yy.
If zz's dirty xx becomes clean, then dirt is off xx.
If zz's xx splashes to zz's yy, then xx is on yy.
