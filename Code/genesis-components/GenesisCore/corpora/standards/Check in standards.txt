Community standards for check in

1. We will not check in any code unless our it produces the results expected for the check in test files.
   The check-in test files are activated as follows:
   o Navigate to Controls > Debugging > Check in tests
   o Click on all the buttons and compare your results with those in this directory
   
2. Also run QuickTests.java in the test package
   
3. Whenever working in those parts of the system everyone depends on, we will comment
   all changes with our name (or email address) and date (3 July 2013).
   
4. We will not change any file names in the corpora stories without changing them wherever used.

5. We will not check in code with debugging print statements that produce copious output.
