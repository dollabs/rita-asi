//Patrick leaves home. // -> "oo does not want the stove on"
//Thermostat turned off.
//Temperature increased in kitchen. 
//The stove is definitely operating. // -> "Stove is on" -> "I turn off the stove"

////THE FOLLOWING IS A NEW, MORE COMMON STORY
// Alex is home. I have a high trust level. There are two pending maintenance requests. 
// The apartment door opened. //=>Alex may have left home. //=>Someone else may have entered. 
// Motion not detected for 30 minutes. //=> Alex has left home (prob .9). || Occupants may be out of range of sensors (prob .1).
// 
// Knocking detected on apartment door. //=> A friend may be at the door, a maintenance person may be at the door //<=> Owner is not home. Owner will want to know someone is at the door. 
// Then, the apartment door opened. //=> Alex may have returned, a maintenance person may have entered //<=> Owner is not home. Owner will want to know someone has entered. //=> ask if maintenance person //=> notify Alex
// Then, the door stayed open for 1 minute. 
// After 15 minutes, the door opened. //The occupant may have exited (.8) // Someone else may have arrived (.2) 
// Motion not detected for 30 minutes. //=>The occupant has exited (.9)
// After 60 minutes, a maintenance request was fulfilled. //The occupant was a maintenance person 
//
// Alex's code unlocked the building door.
// Then within five minutes, the apartment door opened. //trust level=high and within 5 minutes => Alex returned home => I should welcome Alex home, I should bring Alex up to speed 
//# else (eg., trust level=low) => Alex may have returned home => notify Alex.
// I say "Welcome home, Alist!" // => I welcomed Alex home.
// I say: "A maintenance person was in while you were out." 
// I ask Alex: "Did you catch that?"
// Alex doesn't respond for 15 seconds. => I should ask him again. 
// I tell Alex: "A maintenance person was in while you were out." 
// I ask Alex: "Did you catch that: say yes, no, or explain?"
// Alex said "explain" : "the "bathroom sink" maintenance request was fulfilled."
// I ask Alex: "Did you catch that"
// Alex said "yes" //=> Alex knows someone entered while he was out. //=> Then, Alex became up to speed.
