	<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>This is a sample Paranoid Delusion Task. Given the brief story on the left, healthy humans experience no paranoia, while paranoid delusion is common among some schizophrenic humans.

	<h1>What you see</h1>
		<p>Motivated by previous schizophrenia literature, we modified Genesis with "Hyper-presumption", creating GenesisHP. GenesisHP serves as a biologically plausible, falsifiable model of schizophrenic thought.
		<p>We administered a Paranoid Delusion Task to Unmodified Genesis and GenesisHP.
		<p><b>ON THE LEFT</b> Unmodified Genesis exhibited healthy behavior.
		<p><b>ON THE RIGHT</b> GenesisHP exhibited schizophrenic behavior.
