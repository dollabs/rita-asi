	<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>This is a sample Persistence of Delusion Task. Given the brief story on the left, healthy humans experience no paranoia, while paranoid delusion is common among some schizophrenic humans.

	<h1>What you see</h1>
		<p>Motivated by previous schizophrenia literature, we modified Genesis with "Failure-at-Mentalizing", creating GenesisFaM. GenesisFaM serves as a biologically plausible, falsifiable model of schizophrenic thought.
		<p>We administered a Persistence of Delusion Task to Unmodified Genesis and GenesisFaM.
		<p><b>ON THE LEFT</b> Unmodified Genesis exhibited healthy behavior.
		<p><b>ON THE RIGHT</b> GenesisFaM exhibited documented schizophrenic perplexity. GenesisFaM did not exhibit full schizophrenic paranoia.
