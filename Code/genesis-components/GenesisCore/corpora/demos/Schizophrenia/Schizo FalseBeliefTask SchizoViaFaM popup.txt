	<h1>Background</h1>
		<p>This is a sample False Belief Task. Given the brief story on the left, [H] indicates documented predictions by healthy humans, and [S] indicates documented predictions by some schizophrenic humans.

	<h1>What you see</h1>
		<p>Motivated by previous schizophrenia literature, we modified Genesis with "Failure-at-Mentalizing", creating GenesisFaM. GenesisFaM serves as a biologically plausible, falsifiable model of schizophrenic thought.
		<p>We administered a False Belief Task to Unmodified Genesis and GenesisFaM.
		<p><b>ON THE LEFT</b> Unmodified Genesis exhibited healthy behavior.
		<p><b>ON THE RIGHT</b> GenesisFaM induced schizophrenic perplexity, causing schizophrenic behavior.
