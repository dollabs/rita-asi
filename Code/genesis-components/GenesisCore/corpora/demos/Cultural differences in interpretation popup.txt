<h1>What you see</h1>

Genesis uses two sets of common sense rules and concept patterns to read a short, simple version of Macbeth&mdash;about 100 lines&mdash;and constructs two <i>elaboration graphs</i>.

<p>
The elaboration graph on the left reflects the Asian bias toward viewing violence <i>situationally</i>, that is, as a consequence of situations in which the
actors are immersed; the elaboration graph on the right reflects the Western bias toward viewing violence <i>dispositionally</i>, that is, as a consequence of
actor characteristics.

<p>
The demonstration also illustrates how Genesis answers <i>why</i> questions (on the common sense and the conceptual level) and how questions 
(by reporting on the steps involved).

<h1>What you can do</h1>

<ul>
<li> Click or right click to zoom in or out on the elaboration graph.  Press and drag to move the elaboration graph.
<li> Press <i>Revenge</i> button at the bottom of the left elaboration graph and examine the elements involved in the <i>Inspector</i> pane.
     You see that <i>Macduff kills Macbeth</i> is situational.  Press the <i>Insane violence</i> buttons on the right until you
     find the concept pattern in which Macduff kills Macbeth.  On this side, you see that the killing is dispositional.
</ul>
