Imagine a bird is above the top of the house.
Imagine a dog ran from a house to a tree.
Imagine a cat appeared.
Imagine a horse appeared after the weather changed.
Imagine a robin disappeared because a kestrel flew over the tree.
// Imagine a president forced the dictator to run to a hole.
// Imagine a president wanted the country to move toward democracy.
