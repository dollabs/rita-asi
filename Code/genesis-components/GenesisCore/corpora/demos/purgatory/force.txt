/**
* First sentence:
* The first time the dog asks the cat to run, it is unclear what the outcome will be.
* We can only tell that the cat probably wanted to stay still, represented by the dot.
* Second sentence:
* The dog then forces the cat to run. The circle means the cat wants to stay still.
* The + means that the dog wins the conflict. The arrow on the line means that the cat will move.
* Third sentence:
* Now when told the dog asks the cat to run, Gauntlet looks in memory to see if the dog
* had previously been able to make the cat run to a tree. Because it has, the ForceViewer shows the same thing.
* Fourth sentence:
* ForceViewer also works on causation, because coercion is a subset of force interactions.
