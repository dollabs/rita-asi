<h1>What you see</h1>

Genesis reads a story about how an Asian student commits brutal murders.  Then, Genesis is asked about 
whether the student was motivated by America's glorification of violence.

<p>
When Genesis reads the story with an Asian model, Genesis inspects that models beliefs and notes that one belief is, in fact,
that America glorifies violence.  Genesis inserts that belief into the story.

<p>
The inserted belief triggers rules that connect America's glorification of violence to the murder.  Genesis reports on its own reflections
and provides a play-by-play articulation of what it has done.

<p>
When Genesis reads the story with a Western model, Genesis notes no such belief as America glorifies violence and reports
that the question makes no sense.
