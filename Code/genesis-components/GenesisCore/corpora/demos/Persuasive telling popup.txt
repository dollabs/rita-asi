<h1>What you see</h1>

Genesis reads Hansel and Gretel and then retells the story to make the Woodcutter look likable 
by striking out some elements (red) and emphasizing others (green).

<h1>What you can do</h1>

<ul>
<li> Scroll up and down in the story to see what is struck out and what is emphasized.
<li> Change <i>likable</i> to <i>unlikable</i> in the text box and press enter.  Scroll to see the changes in how the story is told.
</ul>

The example is from the MEng thesis of Sila Sayan.
