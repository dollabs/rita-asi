<h1>What you see</h1>
<p>The program will read a short courtroom-style story about 
a husband who uses a gun to defend himself from his wife's knife-wielding lover. 
Based on the events in the story, the program reasons that the story 
is about self-defense. 
</p>
<p>
When asked how the analysis would differ if the lover did not brandish a knife, the program is able to reason about its own thinking;
it concludes that in the second case, the husband's response is unjustified.
