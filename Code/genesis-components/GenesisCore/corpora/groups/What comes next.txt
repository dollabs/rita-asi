Alice is a person.
Bob is a person.

xx, yy, and zz are entities.

vv is a variable.

uu is a variable.

aa is an action.


The battery, cover, and phone are entities.


Start description of "Action-evoking goal".
 xx's wanting vv leads to aa.
The end.

If xx took the cover off of yy, then xx must want to expose yy's parts.
If xx extracts yy from zz, then xx must want to separate yy from zz.
If xx takes yy into zz, then yy is in zz.
If xx needs his cell phone, xx must be expecting an important call.
