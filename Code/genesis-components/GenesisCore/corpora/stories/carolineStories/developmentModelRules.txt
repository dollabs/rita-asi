Start experiment.

Set bottom panel to Elaboration graph.

A three-year-old is a kind of person.
A three-and-a-half-year-old is a kind of person.
A four-year-old is a kind of person.

VV is a thing.
WW is a person.
XX is a person.
YY is a physical-thing.
ZZ is a psych-thing.
AA is a physical-thing.
BB is a psych-thing.


//phys --> phys: YY --> AA
//psych --> psych: ZZ --> BB
//psych --> phys: ZZ --> AA

If XX is a three-year-old then XX may believe that YY causes AA.

//If XX runs, then XX is running.
If XX runs, then Activ is a has_run.
If XX runs in VV, then XX contacts VV.
//With probability 0.5 if XX is a three-year-old and WW runs in VV and WW becomes sick, then XX believes WW becomes sick because WW runs in VV.
If XX is a three-year-old and WW runs in VV and WW becomes sick, then XX believes WW becomes sick because WW runs in VV.
Has_run is a kind of physical-thing.
Feeling is a kind of psych-thing.

Sickness is a kind of physical-thing.
Sickness is a kind of psych-thing.
Bambi is a deer. Bambi is a boy.
Activ is a thing.


Start story titled "Model Test".

Test_subject is a three-year-old.

Bambi runs in the pine grove.
Bambi becomes sick.

//If xx is three and yy runs to lake and yy becomes sick, then xx believes yy becomes sick because yy runs to lake.

The end.
