--MARKF AND I MADE THIS STORY UP - IT IS FICTIONAL--

The background for the story is that Russia and China are countries in a group we'll call "MonitoringStates".  
  Also included in the group is "GreedyCompanies", which is led by "Yahoo".  
  Everybody wants to have control over the production of "Hardware" because it will enable them to produce
  "Spyware" that they can use to monitor users' computers for dissident behavior.

In our story, the SpywareIndustry is aware that Sergei (Brin), a member of Russia, will someday destroy 
  the SpywareIndustry.  In the name of self-preservation, the SpywareIndustry's representative "Greed"
  compels the powerful Yahoo company to want Sergei dead.

Yahoo exerts its influence to take control of Hardware from China, its current owners, and grant it to Russia. 
  As expected, China and its principle hardware company, "Lenovo", feels slighted by the move and attacks 
  Russia to regain Hardware control.  Unexpectedly, in the struggle, China manages to kill Sergei's father, 
  a "Hacker", but not Sergei himself.

Sergei runs away from Russia and joins a new organization, "Google", which he thereafter leads.  
  Google charges into the hardware market, heavily sanctions both Yahoo and China for their activities, 
  and then seizes control of the Hardware for themselves, ceasing Spyware production.  

We should see that Sergei exacts revenge on Lenovo for killing his father by sanctioning them and seizing 
  the hardware-control that they so desperately wanted.
