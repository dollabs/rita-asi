Start story titled "Stops Being test".
Alice, Bobby, Carla, and David are persons.

// 1. If two people are happy at the same time, rule fires.
Alice becomes happy.
Bobby becomes happy. //expect Alice hugs Bobby, Bobby hugs Alice

// 2. If someone (Alice) stops being happy, they should no longer match rule.
Alice stops being happy.
Carla becomes happy. //expect Bobby hugs Carla, Carla hugs Bobby; not Alice-Carla

// reset so no one is happy
Carla stops being happy.
Bobby stops being happy.

// 3. If someone (Alice) becomes happy a second time, they should again match rule.
Alice becomes happy. //might need "Then"?
David becomes happy. //expect Alice hugs David, David hugs Alice

The end.

// 4. It would be nice (but not essential) to also be able to answer questions:
//Insert into text box: When Bobby was happy, was David happy? //expect NO
