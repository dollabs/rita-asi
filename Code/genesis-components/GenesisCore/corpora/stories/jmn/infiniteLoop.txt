//Infinite recursive loop
//based on a bug found with InferEnterExit2, June 2016

Start experiment.

Start common sense knowledge.
xx is a person.
If xx falls asleep, then xx enters the scene. //To fix infinite loop, change "enters the scene" to "loses consciousness"
//If xx awakens, then xx enters the scene.


Start story titled "Infinite Loop".

David plays frisbee. //infer David enters
David falls asleep. //infer David exits
Alice is lonely. //David doesn't observe

David awakens. //ideally, use this to infer David enters again.
               //Currently, infer David enters -> stuck in a loop

Alice is happy. //David should observe, but currently doesn't

The end.
