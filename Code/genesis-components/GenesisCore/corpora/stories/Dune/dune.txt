/** Capen Low - 1/21/10
 *   Finally, after actually getting some mobile operations going in CSAIL, I can compile my notes on
 * Frank Herbert's sci-fi masterpiece, Dune, which I'll be using as a foundational first step in
 * international relations.  The story is straight-forward at the level of resolution that we've been
 * using for the works of Shakespeare up to this point.  The story encompasses a lot of basic elements
 * of nations, rivalries, hierarchies, and several forms of 'goal inheritance'.  I should mention that
 * Goal Inheritance refers to those cases whereby one actor takes on the goals/motivations of another
 * actor by any means, including intimidation, sympathy, or the actors literally encompassing one another.
 *
 *   All told, I'm very excited to see this work.  If we get all the little Revenges and political movements
 * down correctly, then we should see a very exciting unit indeed: the COERCED AGREEMENT BUNGLED, wherein
 * we see that the Guild, through the Navigator, extracts a promise to kill Paul from the Emperor Shaddam IV.
 * Shaddam IV executes a plan whereby he tries to endanger Paul by slighting House Harkonnen, the rivals of
 * Paul's native House Atreides, in favor of the Atreides, knowing that the Harkonnen are vindictive and cruel.
 * Shaddam removes the Harkonnen as overseers of the planet Dune, the only known source of the Spice, Melange,
 * a valuable resource needed for any form of significant space travel, thus making the Spice quite necessary to
 * the Spacing Guild.
 *
 *  In any case, the plan doesn't work and Shaddam ends up killed, so we'll see that he fails to fulfill his
 * promise and so on.

/*  RULES -- These aren't phrased properly yet for the most part, these are just textual copies

1. XX [Entity] want AA [Action] + AA ==> XX happy [and inverse]
2. [BELIEF] --- we'll just have to state this as fact for now, but must go in later.
3. [CONTRAPOSITIVE] --- applies to logical statements.  beware of inf. loops.
4. Inverse of 1.

5. XX may COMPEL YY [Entity] to perform AA if XX INTIMIDATES YY
6. If XX COMPELS YY to perform AA, then YY does AA.  ---  just to be clear

7. HIERARCHICAL GOALS
7a. If XX JOINS YY, then XX becomes member of YY.
7b. If XX LEADS YY + XX wants AA ===> YY wants AA.
7c. If XX REPRESENTS YY + YY wants AA ===> XX wants AA.

8. States want to control Regions.

9. If XX GOVERNS BB [Bloc] + YY is a member of BB ===> XX GOVERNS YY
10. If XX governs YY and ZZ [Entity] + YY controls RR [Region] ===>  XX may grant RR to ZZ
11. If XX grants RR to ZZ, then ZZ controls YY.
11b. ONLY ONE ENTITY CONTROLS ANY GIVEN REGION AT ONCE [figure out way to phrase this - probably "becomes controller..."]

12. If XX attacks YY at RR ==>
         XX harms YY,
         XX may kill PP [Person] who is at RR,
         YY may kill PP who is at RR,
         RR's controller may stop controlling RR.  //Note: Controller not necessarily YY.
         XX may start controlling RR.  //Note: Might want a separate conquest rule or something.
