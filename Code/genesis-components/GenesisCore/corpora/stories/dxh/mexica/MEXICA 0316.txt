THAT DAY THE PRINCESS' HEART WAS FULL OF ENERGY.
THE ARTIST WAS A PROUD NATIVE OF THE GREAT CITY.

THE ARTIST WAS IMPRESSED BY THE PRINCESS AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.
THE PRINCESS AND THE ARTIST WERE GOOD FRIENDS.
THE PRINCESS APPRECIATED THE ARTIST'S FRIENDSHIP. WHY DID THE ARTIST FALL IN LOVE WITH HER? THE PRINCESS WAS MAD!
THE PRINCESS AND THE HUNTER FLIRTED WITH EACH OTHER OPENLY.
THEY COULD NOT HELP IT: THE PRINCESS AND THE HUNTER FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.
THE MUTUAL FEELINGS BETWEEN THE ARTIST AND THE HUNTER WERE EVIDENT TO EVERYONE.
WHEN THE ARTIST REALIZED THAT THE HUNTER HAD FEELINGS FOR THE PRINCESS, HE FREAKED OUT!
