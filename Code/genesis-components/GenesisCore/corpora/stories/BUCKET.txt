Alice is a person.

xx is an entity.

yy is an entity.


XX may fall because XX runs and XX holds YY.

XX drops YY because XX falls and XX holds YY.

XX slows down because XX runs and XX holds YY.

XX fails because XX falls and XX drops YY.

XX worries because XX slows down and XX drops YY.

XX may scream because XX falls.

//"XX learns" cannot be inferred using "XX worries" , but can be inferred from "XX drops YY".
XX may learn because XX fails and because XX drops YY.//XX worries

XX runs because XX sees YY.

// Below are the rules for story2
ZZ is an entity.

WW is an entity.

ZZ follows the rabbit because ZZ runs and because ZZ is curious.

ZZ may jump into XX because ZZ follows the rabbit and because rabbit jumps into XX.

XX leads to the wonderland because XX is magic.

//Bucket imagination test: iteration one.

Start story titled "Bucket test".

Alice holds the bucket.

//Alice runs.

Alice falls.

Alice learns.

Alice screams.

Alice sees the rabbit.

Alice is curious.

Rabbit jumps into the hole.

Alice jumps into the hole.

//So now when I say imagine a person running with a bucket this is supposed to be imagined
//based on the story above.
//Now I need to say something like imagine more, and this will invoke a second iteration.
//In reality, imagination isn't a rule-based inference, but rather an involvement of new
//representations that weren't involved before. But let's try the second iteration as it is right now. 


The end.
