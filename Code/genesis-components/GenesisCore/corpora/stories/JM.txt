First perspective.

Start story titled "John and Mary".

John and Mary played a game of hide-and-seek-the-ball with a green ball.

They began in a large room with two doors, one on the north side, one on the east, with several balls in the center of the floor.

John went first, picking up the ball and walking through the north door.

The north room was smaller than the large room, and contained a table and a chair in the center, with a cabinet against the wall.

John placed the ball underneath the chair, and called out to Mary to come find it.

Mary entered the north room, walked over the cabinet, and opened it.

Not seeing the ball in the cabinet, she slowly turned around until she saw the ball under the chair.

She picked up the ball and left the room by the south door.

She crossed the large room, and entered the east room, which was also smaller than the large room, but much taller.

There were a number of crates in the room, along with a shelf attached to the wall, high up, so high that Mary could not reach it.

She bounced the ball just right so that it flew up and landed on the ledge.

She called out to John for him to come find the ball.

John enters the east room and looks around, but does not see the ball.

He first looked between one crate and the wall, then another, then a third, but did not see the ball.

He then realized the ball must be on the shelf; he jumped up to try and see it , but could not.

He climbed on top of one of the crates, and could then see the ball in its hiding spot.

John went  to the large room, took a red ball, and, returning to tall room, threw the red ball at the green ball, knocking it down to the floor.

The green ball bounced to Mary and she caught it.

She threw it to John, but he dropped it.

He picked up the ball, and it was now his turn. 

The end.
