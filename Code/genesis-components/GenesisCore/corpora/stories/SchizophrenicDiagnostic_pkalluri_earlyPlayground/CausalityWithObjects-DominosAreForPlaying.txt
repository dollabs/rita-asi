Start experiment.





//Rules
xx and zz are dominos.
oo is an object.
ppp is a person.

//Prediction

If zz is upright and zz is right of xx and xx falls right, then zz falls right.

//Pres
//If ppp pushes xx, then xx can fall right.

//Unused
//If zz is up and zz is directly right of xx and xx touches zz, then zz may fall right.
// An abduction rule; note use of "must be"
//If xx falls then xx must be blue.
//Xx's being upright enables xx's falling.
