Start story.

Mark collects the pile of silver bags. He carries them inside. Mark stands in the kitchen, surrounded by silver bags. He fills a large container with water from the Reclaimer. He dumps in the contents of the compost bin. Then he stares at the bags. He does not look happy. He tears open a bag and dumps the contents into the bin. Then he tears open another bag. As he does so, he starts to GAG. Mark scoops Martian dirt into a container with a small shovel. He carries the container to the airlock. Mark enters the Hab. He dumps his container of dirt into a corner where he has cleared an empty area. Mark enters with another container. There is now a HUGE PILE of dirt in the corner. Mark has spread the dirt over a third of the Hab floor. He stares at the compost bin. Then he takes a deep breath. Opens the bin. Begins dumping it over the Martian dirt. He can’t hold his breath forever. He breathes eventually. Oh god, that’s horrible. Mark cuts each potato into four quarters, making sure each quarter has at least two eyes. He begins planting each potato-quarter in nice orderly rows. The ENTIRE HAB is now covered in SOIL. Not just the floor. Mark has cleared every available surface -- bunks, countertops, table -- and covered it with his dirt.

The end.
