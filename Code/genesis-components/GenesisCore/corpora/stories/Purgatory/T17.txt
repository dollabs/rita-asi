Clear text.
Clear story memory.

XX is an entity.
YY is an entity.
ZZ is an entity.
BB is bloc.
Group1 is group.
RR is region.


//Government
XX governs YY because XX governs BB, BB includes YY, and BB is bloc.
XX governs YY because XX leads Group1, Group1 governs YY, and Group1 is group.  // LEADERS OF GOVERNING BODY ALSO GOVERN SUBJECTS

// CRITICAL ELEMENTS of Land Seizure
XX may seize RR from YY because XX governed YY, and YY controlled RR.	// A governor can seize your territory

YY's controlling of RR did not occur because XX seized RR from YY.		// If seized, you stop controlling it.
XX controls RR because XX seized RR from YY.							// Temporary hold - separate from control.
Group1 controls RR because XX controls RR, and XX leads Group1.
//XX may grant RR to ZZ because XX holds RR.							// Can't grant without holding/controlling it.
XX may grant RR to ZZ because XX controls RR, and XX governs ZZ.
ZZ controls RR because XX granted RR to ZZ.								// And control transfers with a grant.

//Rivalry + Seizure
YY harms ZZ because XX seized RR from ZZ, XX granted RR to YY, and ZZ dislikes YY.

//Hatred
XX dislikes YY because XX hates YY.
