Clear text.
Clear story memory.

XX, YY, ZZ are entities.
BB is bloc.
Group1 is group.
RR is region.


//Government
// Word choice of "[Bloc] INCLUDES [Member]" because the phrase "is a member of" gets interpreted
//	strangely in complicated sentences.  See:   
//	XX governs YY because XX governs BB, YY is a member of BB, and BB is bloc.
XX governs YY because XX governs BB, BB includes YY, and BB is bloc.
XX governs YY because XX leads Group1, Group1 governs YY, and Group1 is group.  // LEADERS OF GOVERNING BODY ALSO GOVERN SUBJECTS

//Land Seizure
XX may seize RR from YY because XX governed YY, and YY controlled RR.	// A governor can seize your territory

/*
YY's controlling of RR did not occur because XX seized RR from YY.		// If seized, you stop controlling it.
XX holds RR because XX seized RR.										// Temporary hold - separate from control.
Group1 holds RR because XX holds RR, and XX leads Group1.
XX may grant RR to ZZ because XX holds RR.								// Can't grant without holding/controlling it.
XX may grant RR to ZZ because XX controls RR.
ZZ controls RR because XX granted RR to ZZ.								// And control transfers with a grant.


//Rivalry + Seizure
YY harms ZZ because XX seized RR from ZZ, XX granted RR to YY, and ZZ dislikes YY.

//Hatred
XX dislikes YY because XX hates YY.
