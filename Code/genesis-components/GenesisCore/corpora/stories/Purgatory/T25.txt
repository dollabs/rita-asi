	Test to ensure that variables operate properly.

Germany should want to control Nice because Germany values Iron and Nice contains Iron.
France should also want to control Nice because of the coveted Wine.

However, note the existence of:
	"Germany|France wants to control Iron|Wine."

This perhaps makes sense, but there is no rule dictating that this should happen.
I think it's treating RSC the same as RR because of how their threads are constructed, i.e.
	"thing name RR"
	"thing name RSC"
	
Note that this is coming up now because some of our other variables like AA and XX already have
	existing threads (e.g. Chromosomes, Lava, etc.)

Clear text.
Clear story memory.

XX is entity.  
YY is entity.
RR is region.
SS is state.
RSC is resource.

//Desire 
	XX becomes happy because XX wanted an action to occur and the action occurred.
	XX becomes unhappy because XX wanted an action to occur and the action did not occur.

SS values RR because SS values RSC, and RR contains RSC.			
SS wants to control RR because SS values RR.
SS controls RSC because RR contains RSC, and SS controls RR.

Start story.

Germany and France are nations.

Iron and Wine are resources.

Germany values Iron.
France values Wine.

Nice is a region.
Nice contains Wine.
Nice contains Iron.

Germany controls Nice.

//Example sentence that causes rubbish conclusions:
Germany values Tacos.
		//Germany should not want to control tacos.  Tacos are food, not a region.

The end.
