Start commonsense knowledge.

Both Perspectives.

WW, XX, YY, and ZZ are entities.

// If xx is an entity and yy is an entity and zz is an entity and xx hates zz and yy hates zz, then xx is yy's friend.

// If xx loves yy then xx is a friend of yy.

// If xx harms yy and yy is vindictive, then yy wants to harm xx.

First perspective.

// XX may kill YY because YY angers XX.

If XX is an enemy of ZZ and YY is an enemy of ZZ, then YY may be XX's friend.

If YY is an enemy of ZZ and XX is an enemy of ZZ, then YY may be XX's friend.

Second perspective.

XX may kill YY because XX is not sane.
