Start commonsense knowledge.

WW, XX, YY, and ZZ are persons.

First perspective.

// YY may kill WW because YY is not sane.

Second perspective.

YY may kill WW because YY is angry at WW.

Both perspectives.

WW, XX, YY, and ZZ are entities.

// If xx is an entity and yy is an entity and zz is an entity and xx hates zz and yy hates zz, then xx is yy's friend.

// If xx is an entity and yy is an entity and zz is an entity and xx is zz's enemy and yy is zz's enemy, then xx is yy's friend.

// If xx loves yy then xx is a friend of yy.

// If xx harms yy and yy is vindictive, then yy wants to harm xx.
