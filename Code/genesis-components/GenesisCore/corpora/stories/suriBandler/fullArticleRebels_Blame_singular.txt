Max is a freedom fighter.

Regime slaughters the freedom fighter.

//The regime killed many children.
The regime is a government. Max is a boy. Max fights for freedom. Max helps our people. Max is killed by the regime. The regime is ruthless. Two barbarians were executed by the freedom fighter and the regime alleges a terrorist classification for the boy. The regime alleges the legitimacy of the boy's death. The boy had no choice. The regime prevents freedom. We want to honor him with a funeral. We wait for the boy's body. Tonight we will host a memorial service. This was a barbaric attack. We increase the resistance. Join us and fight with us for freedom. The end.
