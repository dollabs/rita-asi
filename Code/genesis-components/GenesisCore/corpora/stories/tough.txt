These attacks lasted several weeks and gravely disrupted activities of the country’s government, media and financial system.

The attacks occurred during a dispute between the Estonian and Russian governments over Estonia’s relocation of a memorial to World War II Russian soldiers.

Estonian officials charged the Russian government with having organized the attacks, but acknowledged a lack of conclusive evidence.
