//// Supplement to commonsense knowledge.

// Variable declaration
XX is an entity.
YY is an entity.
ZZ is an entity.

CC is a thing.

NN is a nation.

// Some basic emotions...
XX became unhappy because YY harmed XX.

// Allies/Foes
//XX is YY's foe because XX is a member of MM, YY is a member of NN, and MM is NN's rival.
//XX is YY's ally because XX is a member of MM, and YY is a member of MM.

// Valued Resources
XX values YY because YY is a hero, YY is a member of NN, XX is a member of NN, and XX became nationalist.
XX values CC because CC is a computer, CC became nationalist, XX became nationalist, XX is a member of NN, and CC is a member of NN. 


// Heroic Duels

XX becomes enthusiastic because YY is a hero, ZZ is a hero, XX became nationalist, XX is a member of MM, YY is a member of MM, ZZ is a member of NN, MM is NN's rival, and YY defeats ZZ.

// Insults
//XX may insult YY because YY is an entity, XX is a member of NN, YY is a member of MM, and NN is MM's rival.
//XX may insult ZZ because ZZ is an entity, YY values ZZ, and YY harmed XX.
XX may insult YY because YY is an entity, XX is a member of NN, YY is a member of MM, NN is MM's rival, and XX became miffed. 


// Substitution for reflective reasoning of "Hack->Harm" and "Insult->Harm"
XX harms YY because XX insults ZZ, ZZ is an entity, and YY values ZZ.
XX harms YY because XX hacks CC, CC is a computer, and YY values CC.


// Hacking
XX may hack CC because CC is an entity, CC harmed XX, CC is a member of NN, XX is a member of MM, and MM is NN's rival.
XX may hack CC because YY is an entity, YY harmed XX, CC is an entity, CC is a member of NN, YY is a member of NN, XX is a member of MM, and MM is NN's rival.

XX may hack CC because CC is an entity, CC is a member of NN, XX is a member of MM, MM is NN's rival, and XX became enthusiastic.
XX harms YY because XX hacks YY.


// Turning the cheek...
	// Again, we could use reflective here to more readily state
	//	"You get hurt ~~~~~~> You do something nice"
	//	"Helping Chile is doing something nice"
XX may help ZZ because ZZ is an entity, ZZ suffered an earthquake, and YY harmed XX.

XX becomes unhappy because XX suffers an earthquake.
