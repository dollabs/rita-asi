// Leonardo Davinci Notebook

When you wish to draw a speaker, consider his contents and adapt his action to it.
If the contents are persuasive, let his right hand hold his left finger.
If he is giving an argument, turn his face towards the people and make his mouth open slightly.
If he is seated, let him appear soon to rise, with his head forward.
If he stands, make him lean slightly forward with his head towards the people.
You should make the audience look silent and attentive.
And make some old men astonished at the contents.
Make many wrinkles on the old men's foreheads.
Make some men sitting with their fingers clasped over their weary knees.

// When you wish to represent a man speaking among a group of persons, consider the matter of which he has to treat and adapt his action to the subject.
// If the subject is persuasive, let his action be in keeping.
// If the matter is to set forth an argument, let the speaker with the fingers of the right hand hold one finger of the left hand keeping the two smaller ones closed; and his face alert and turned towards the people, with mouth slightly open to look as though he spoke.
// If he is seated, let him appear as though about to rise, with his head forward.
// If you represent him standing, make him leaning slightly forward with head and shoulders towards the people.
// You should represent the audience as silent and attentive and all watching the face of the orator with gestures of admiration.
// And make some old men in astonishment at what they hear, with the corners of their mouths pulled down drawing back the cheeks in many furrows with their eyebrows raised where they meet. Make many wrinkles on their foreheads. Make some sitting with their fingers clasped over their weary knees; and some bent old man, with one knee crossed over the other and one hand resting upon it and holding his other elbow and the hand supporting the bearded chin.
