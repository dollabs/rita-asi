Also, to maximize points overall I would need to save as many yellow victims before the time ran out. ",1,"Instead of going through the rooms and searching it, I could just run by the doorway making it much quicker. However, I still checked some of the rooms the device didn't beep in case I needed to find another entrance around blockage. In addition, due to the fact that the devices only beeps, there were times that I was confused as to which door it beeped on since there is no way to determine which door it beeped on unless you observe it. ","My plan was to travel to all of the rooms as quickly as possible by not repeating rooms. 
","My strategy was the same as mission 1 but after knowing the layout I tried to maximize the path by traveling through the middle section throughout the mission rather than approaching the middle as a specific section. ","I tried to refine mission 2's path even more by eliminating the distance I would be looping around back to the left or right side.
","My strategy was more or less refined throughout the experiment. In general I tried to memorize my path so I had an idea of what to do, but in the case of blockages I had to plan on the spot what I should do. ",My strategy was to rescue the yellow victims first since I can maximize the amount of victims I save if I save them all in the first half of the mission and then focus on the green victims during the second half of the mission.,My strategy was to rescue the yellow victims first since I can maximize the amount of victims I save if I save them all in the first half of the mission and then focus on the green victims during the second half of the mission.,My strategy was to rescue the yellow victims first since I can maximize the amount of victims I save if I save them all in the first half of the mission and then focus on the green victims during the second half of the mission.,"No, because I knew I would not have enough time to save the green victims and the yellow victims in the first half due to how long it takes to save a yellow victim.",1,"The static map was useful as I could understand the layout of the map before I entered, meaning I could be more efficient with my paths.
