# plan-schema

Schema validation and coercion utilities for TPNs and HTNs

As this is a pre-release version **plan-schema** has not been
published to [Clojars](https://clojars.org/). You can still clone it and install
it locally.

Check out the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Documentation

The **plan-schema** library is part of the [PAMELA](https://github.com/dollabs/pamela) suite of tools.

See the [API docs](http://dollabs.github.io/plan-schema/doc/api/)

## Building

The **plan-schema** library uses [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) as a build tool. For
more on boot see [Sean's blog](http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/02/02/boot-new/) and the [boot Wiki](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki).

Install [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) if you haven't done so already.

Copy [boot.properties](doc/config/boot.properties) to `~/.boot/boot.properties` (if you haven't customized it yet). *NOTE*: **plan-schema** *requires* Clojure 1.8.0 or later (`BOOT_CLOJURE_VERSION=1.8.0`)

Copy [profile.boot](doc/config/profile.boot) to `~/.boot/profile.boot` (if you haven't customized it yet).

 * Emacs users: when you are ready for interactive development see the comment
   about the `cider-boot` task in [build.boot](build.boot)
 * [Cursive](https://github.com/cursive-ide/cursive) users: use this to
   create a **project.clj** file that Cursive will like.

 ````
boot lein-generate
````

In order to use the **plan-schema** with other programs
(e.g. [planviz](https://github.com/dollabs/planviz))
you need to install it in your local repository
(i.e. where Maven puts files, usually `~/.m2`):

````
boot local
````


## Usage

For convenience you may add the [plan-schema/bin](bin) directory to your `PATH`
(or simply refer to the startup script as `./bin/plan-schema`).
