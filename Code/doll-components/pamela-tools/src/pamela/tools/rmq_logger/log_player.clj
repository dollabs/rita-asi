; Python RMQ player
;  * Cannot keep up with thousands of events over extended periods of time
;    * Delayed publishing of events instead of real time events
;    * No clear lib available for scheduling real time events

;; Modus Operandi
; Read from RMQ Log files into memory
; store events ordered by time
; schedule events to be fired at absolute time, after a delay Xmillis
; One timer for all events to be fired at time T

; Note timer is single threaded. i.e if the timer thread is blocked, it won't fire next thread until released. This will
; cause some tightly spaced events to delayed in dispatching only if there are 1000s of them. We expect few, maybe 10 events to be
; fired at exactly same time T  but not 1000s
