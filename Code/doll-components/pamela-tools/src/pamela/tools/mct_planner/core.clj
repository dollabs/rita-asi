(comment
  -- use iterations and collect results
  -- Test with first.json
  -- Update max etc constraints.
  -- What about vars with * as value)


; 1. track constraint violation. Which constraints failed for each sample.
;    For each value of var, which expression failed.
; once we know that a constraint expression failed or success, we should not check again.
; i.e we check only if they have unbound vars.

; 2. entropy calculation to select next variable

; 3. add cost and reward vars.

; 4. Need measurement of how good a sample is.

; 5. add choice constraint
