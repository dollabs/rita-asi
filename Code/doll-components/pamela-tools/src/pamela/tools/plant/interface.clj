; Plant Interface is a collection of messages exchanged between planner components and plant implementation.
; Messages are sent over the wire in json format. Currently, we use rabbit mq for messaging between all components.
; All json keys and values are assumed to be required unless noted as optional.
; All timestamps are assumed to be unix time in millis since epoch (1 jan 1970)
; Examples of all messages are below and are in clojure format.

    "Command to the plant to start the function identified by 'function-name' and args.
     Args are specified by both positional 'args' and named args via 'argsmap'
     plant-id is the unique identifier of each plant. The value comes from :id field as specified in pamela model.
     This message is published using plant-id as routing key or #plant if there is no :id in the pamela model.
     id uniquely identifies a invocation of a function. Multiple invocations of the same function will have different ids.
