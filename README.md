# ASIST RITA

## RITA is the Robust Ideal Team Assistant - An ASI (Artificial Social Intelligence) Agent

The DOLL Team (DOLL and MIT CSAIL) is developing RITA, an artificial social intelligence (ASI) agent that uses: Analytic Components developed by other ASIST performers, State Estimation components to construct a Theory of Mind (ToM) of all the human members of a team, Story Understanding to frame those beliefs into grounded stories, and then generates interventions that are shared with team members resulting in improved team behaviors. 

## RITA Open Source Release

**This is a bare-bones snapshot of the RITA ASI that was used in the DARPA ASIST Study 3. **

In the near future (1Q 2024), we will provide documentation and examples from our work in DARPA ASIST Study 4.

## Building RITA
To build the Docker images for the RITA ASI, do the following:
