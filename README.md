# ASIST RITA Open Source


This is a bare-bones snapshot of the RITA ASI that was used in the DARPA ASIST Study 3. 

We intend to provide documentation and examples as part of the work we are doing for DARPA ASIST Study 4.

## Building RITA
To build the Docker images for the RITA ASI, do the following:

* `cd Code`
